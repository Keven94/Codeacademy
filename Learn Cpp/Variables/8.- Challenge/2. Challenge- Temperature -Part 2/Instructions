Let's go back to the temperature.cpp that we wrote. 
This time, instead of giving tempf a value of the current temperature in New York:

tempf = 83;

Let's ask the user what the temperature is using cin!
Instructions
1.

Tell the user "Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: " using cout.

And get their input using cin and store it in tempf.
2.

Compile and execute your program.
