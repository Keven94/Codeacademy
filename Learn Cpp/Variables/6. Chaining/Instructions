Now that we have outputted a variable and have also outputted things using multiple couts. 
Let's take a closer look at cout again.

If we have the code below:

int age = 28;

std::cout << "Hello, I am ";
std::cout << age;
std::cout << ".\n";

It will output:

Hello, I am 28.

Notice how we use quotes around the characters in "Hello, I am " but not in age. 
We use quotes when we want a literal string. When we don't quote, we refer to the value of something with a name.

So now, is it possible to write the cout statements within a single line?

Yep! You can use multiple << operators to chain the things you want to output.

For the same code above you can also do:

int age = 28;

std::cout << "Hello, I am " << age << ".\n";

This is called chaining.
Instructions
1.

Inside game.cpp, we have declared and initialized an int variable called score.

Now output the following using chaining:

Player score: [score]

where [score] should be the value of the variable score.

Make sure to add a new line after!
