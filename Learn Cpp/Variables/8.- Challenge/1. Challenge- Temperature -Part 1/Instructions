Now that we've learned about the basics of variables and cin, let's write a program!

The mad scientist Kelvin has mastered predicting the weather in his mountain-side meteorology lab.

Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website, however, there's a problem: 
  All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Fahrenheit degrees.

Let's convert a temperature from Fahrenheit (F) to Celsius (C).

The formula is the following:

C=(F−32)/1.8C = (F - 32) / 1.8C=(F−32)/1.8

1.

First, google the current temperature of New York in Fahrenheit.

Save that value in a double variable called tempf.

Also declare another double variable called tempc.
2.

Calculate the result in Celsius.
3.

Display the result.

Output exactly this:

The temp is [tempc] degrees Celsius.

4.

Compile and execute the program.
