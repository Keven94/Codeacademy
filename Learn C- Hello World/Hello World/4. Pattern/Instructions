We learned how to output on a line with the following code:

std::cout << "Hey Jude\n";

It will output:

Hey Jude

We can also output multiple lines by stacking one std::cout statement over another:

std::cout << "Hello\n";
std::cout << "Goodbye\n";

This will output:

Hello
Goodbye

Now let's do a challenge just from what we learned so far!

Instructions
1.

Instead of displaying those two lines in the output, edit the code so that we output the following pattern in the terminal:

       1
     2 3
   4 5 6
7 8 9 10

Exactly how it is.

Remember you can use the hint if you need help.
