Optional: 
The body mass index (BMI) is commonly used by health and nutrition professionals to estimate human body fat in populations.

It is computed by taking the individual's weight in kilograms (kg) and dividing it by the square of their height in meters (m):

bmi = \frac{weight}{height^2}

Finish the bmi.cpp program.
