Like we mentioned in the introduction, another way to assign a value to a variable is through user input. 
A lot of times, we want the user of the program to enter information for the program.

We have cout for output, and there is something called cin is used for input!

std::cout << "Enter your password: ";
std::cin >> password;

The name cin refers to the standard input stream (pronounced "see-in", for character input). 
The second operand of the >> operator ("get from") specifies where that input goes.

To see how it works, we have to try it with a program.
1.

Add the following code:

std::cin >> tip;

So that the user of the program can enter something with their keyboard and what they enter gets saved in the 
int variable named tip.
2.

Let's output the following using chaining:

You paid $[tip]

where the [tip] should be the value of the variable tip.
