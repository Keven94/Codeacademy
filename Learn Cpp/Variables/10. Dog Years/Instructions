    "How old is your fuzzy friend in human years?"

Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. 
If you own a dog, you might've heard this rule: 
  one year for Snoopy equals seven years for you. 
  Turns out, the math isn't that simple. Dogs mature more quickly than we do early on.

Here's how we can convert your dog's age into human years:

    The first two years of a dog's life count as 21 human years.
    Each following year counts as 4 human years.

Woof

So a one-year-old dog is 10.5 years old in human years, and a two-year-old dog is 21 years old in human years... 
hmm this is about to get more complicated. Before you start doing the math in your head, let a computer take care of it!

With your knowledge of variables and arithmetic operators, 
let's write a C++ program to calculate the age, in human years, of any dog older than 3.
Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off
Creating the variables that we need:
1.

Create an int variable named dog_age, and set it equal to your dog's age as a number.

Write a comment that explains this line of code.

Note: This version of the program is for dogs older than 2 years old.
2.

Let's declare three more int variables that we will use later:

    early_years: for your dog's first two years
    later_years: for your dog's following years
    human_years: for your dog's total human years

Solving for the human years:
3.

"The first two years of a dog's life count as 21 human years."

Let's give the variable early_years a value of 21.

Write a comment that explains this line of code.
4.

"Each following year counts as 4 human years."

So the equation looks something like:

later_years=(dog_age−2)∗4later\_years = (dog\_age - 2) * 4later_years=(dog_age−2)∗4

Give the variable later_years a value of dog_age minus 2, and then multiply by 4.

Write a comment that explains this line of code.
5.

Add early_years and later_years together, and store that in a variable named human_years.

Write a comment that explains this line of code.
6.

Write a cout statement that displays your dog's name and age in human years.

Use chaining to display the value in the following sentence:

My name is [NAME]! Ruff ruff, I am [AGE] years old in human years.

Replace [NAME] with your dog's name and [AGE] with the value of human_years in the sentence above.
