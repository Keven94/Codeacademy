You just returned from a trip in Central America. 
The countries you visited were Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Y
ou arrived back in your country with some foreign currencies from these three countries.

Write a C++ program called currency.cpp that prompts the user for the amount of each foreign currency. 
Your prompts should look like:

Enter number of Mexican Pesos:
Enter number of Guatemalan Quetzals:
Enter number of Salvadoran Colóns:

Your program should then convert the amount entered by the user and display the total amount of USD. 
Your final output should look like:

US Dollars = $______

Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off
Creating Variables:
1.

First things first, let's declare 3 variables:

    p for peso
    q for quetzals
    c for colóns

2.

We'll need another variable to store the amount you have in dollars.

Let's declare a variable called dollars.
3.

Compile and execute the code to make sure it's bug-free before moving on!
Asking the questions and taking inputs:
4.

We want to ask the user three different questions:

Enter number of Mexican Pesos:

5.

We then want the user to type in how much they have and store it in p.
6.

Do this for the other two currencies.
Coverting to USD:
7.

Google the conversion rates:

    from pesos to USD
    from quetzals to USD
    from colóns to USD

And write them down in your code using a comment
8.

Write an equation that solves for the total USD.
9.

Display the total amount of USD. Your final output should look like:

US Dollars = $______
