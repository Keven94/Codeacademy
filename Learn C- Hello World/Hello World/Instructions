In between the curly braces is what we are going to focus on for now.

std::cout << "Hello World!\n";

    std::cout        is the "character output stream". It is pronounced "see-out".
    
    <<               is an operator that comes right after it.
    
    "Hello World!\n" is what's being outputted here. You need double quotes around text. 
                        The \n is a special character that indicates a new line.
                        
    ;                is a command that tells the computer that you are at the end of a statement.
